Hello Reader , I was very much fascinated with harry potter cloaking scene in my childhood days. I once discuss about this project with my graduation teacher and he said that we can do this only if we make the refractive index changes to the cloak. Today Open CV has done this within 40-45 line of codes. A magical yet highly in demand technology booming these days.
